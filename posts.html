      <h2>Movie Review: "Those Who Wish Me Dead" (2.8/5 Stars) (5/18/2021)</h2>
      <p>
        So yesterday I decided to go against my better judgement and took a trip
        to the theater to see Angelina Jolie's new flick "Those Who Wish Me
        Dead" directed by Taylor Sheridan. Sheridan is widley recognized for
        films such as "Hell or High Water" and "Sicario". I am a fan of both
        films (the former moreso than the latter). If I were to rank the three,
        however, I would certainly rank Sheridan's new film the worst of the
        three.
        <br /><br />
        In the film, Littlefinger (from GOT; the dad in this flick), is killed
        off early on and his situation is never really explained. Apparently, he
        discovered some big accounting discrepancies and screwwed with the wrong
        guys. Those same very guys begin to hunt LittleFinger (yes still
        referencing GOT) and his kid in order to kill them and cover there
        tails. In the end, Jolie and the Kid get away from the men that were
        orginally following them. They live happily ever after. THE END.
        <br /><br />
        But why were they being followed in the first place?? This is a huge
        question that the writers never answered leaving the audience (ME)
        utterly dissatisfied. The movie seems to be all over the place at times
        and a better job could have been done to keep the audience up to speed
        with what is going on. Besides that this is an ok film. At times, it got
        stale and in my opinion is not a must see by any means. I give it 2.8/5
        stars and would recommend you wait til it comes to TV, whenever that may
        be...
