        Welcome to my Personal Website! I am the site creator Derrick Butler.
        Currently, I am an Operations Monitoring Analyst. Back in December of
        2018, I graduated from Frostburg State University (Frostburg, MD)
        earning my Bachelor's (BS) Degree in Information Technology. Since I was
        a kid, i've been tinkering with all sorts of hardware such as old gaming
        consoles, ipods, cell phones, PCs, and even cars. While in University,
        we worked with a variety of technolgies ranging from virtualization and
        computer programming to networking and operating systems. The summer
        before my graduation I completed an internship at Sandy Spring Bank.
        There my love for helping others and technology was reinforced as I
        worked as a Help Desk Intern. During this time, I was able to: improve
        my troubleshooting and communication skills, gain valuable experience
        interacting in a corporate environment, and learn how to support several
        different technologies.
      </p>

        In school, I was always fascinated with programming but thought it would
        bore me. Yet, years later here I am teaching myself how to code. I enjoy
        it because it is challenging and because it allows you to create things
        you would have never thought you were capable of creating. The languages
        I am teaching myself currently include: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. As I
        progress, I look forward to learning about Node.js, React, SQL, and
        noSQL.
      </p>
      <h2>Hobbies</h2>
      <p>
        Typically, I like to be outdoors and active. I like hiking, biking,
        lifting weights, or just about anything to help stay fit. Other than
        that I enjoy watching sports, playing video games, shopping, trying new
        restaurants, traveling, and of course learning! My favorite Teams are
        the LA Lakers and the New York Giants. I am an Xbox gamer (Series S) and
        these days you can catch me playing Apex Legends, Star Wars Battlefront
        2 or any COD. It is my dream to create my own video game. I hope to soon
        make that dream a reality.
